                We live in a world of information, but increasingly we find our access to information has been severed. 
                Be it visual impairment, social anxiety, or the information simply not being accessible, a sizeable portion 
                of the population has been cut off. TextMap is the response to these issues. Using the tools already available 
                to us, smartphones and screen readers, TextMap uses GPS-technology combined with user-input to give you the 
                information you can not see from the world around you. Helpful to the visually impaired and sighted people 
                alike, TextMap allows you to know exactly what you need before entering any establishment. It also helps 
                the visually impaired read signs they cannot reach, and any text they encounter abroad.

                <p class="text">
                    Visual impairment is defined as the degradation of eyesight to the point where common methods do not work. 
                    The World Health Organization released an article on visual impairment in 2010. 
                    The study concluded an estimate that around 285 million were affected by visual impairment. Out of those 285 million, a whopping 39 million are totally blind. 
                    Compared to the world population, this portion makes up a total of 4.25 percent.
                    Visual impairment restricts several aspects of a persons life on a daily basis. Those who are impaired struggle especially social and occupational environments.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p class="text">
                    To scope out how relevant the issue is, we surveyed 42 respondants in an online 
                    survey published to a public forum dedicated to the Visually Impaired. After filtering 
                    the responses into those who confirmed they were Visually Impaired we found this: 
                </p>

                <img src="media/kake1.png" alt="How often do you encounter text that is inaccessible to you?
                                                11 percent encounter this rarely, 50 percent sometimes, and 39 percent often.">

                <p class="text">
                        Almost 89 percent of visually impaired respondents confirmed they encountered issues with text, information that was 
                        inaccessible to them. The remaining 11 percent answered that they rarely ever had issues. This was further confirmed by what else we found: 
                </p>

                <img src="media/kake2.png" alt="An image of a pie chart visualising how much text is inaccessible in a
                                                day-to-day basis of those who are visually impaired">

                <p class="text">
                        A majority of respondents reported that they did find active difficulties, day to day, 
                        with information that was not accessible to them due to their impairment.
                        A whole 67.7 percent agreed with the statement, while a measely 5.9 percent were opposed to it.
                        From this we understood the issue we were tackling was a relevant one for the visually impaired 
                        community.

                        <br>

                        This was also reflected in our survey, as visually impaired people answered:
                </p>

                <img src="media/kake3.png" alt="An image of a pie chart visualising how many think this application would benefit them of those who are visually impaired">

                <p class="text">
                        A majority of 52.9 percent once again confirms there is an interest in the software we are developing. 
                        The other 11.8 percent did not think the application would benefit them, but this percentage may become less if given the chance to try the application. 
                        The non-visually impaired have also shown interest in our product:
                </p>

                <img src="media/kake4.png" alt="An image of a pie chart visualising how many think this application would benefit them answered by non-visually impaired too">

                <br>
                <p class="text">
                        Not only did those who were impaired interested, but some saw other uses to it than intended. Both charts showed that approximately 52 percent of each demographic saw use in the app.
                        What is confirmed is that among our whole potential user base, 
                        the majority can see a real use in our software:
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                        The survey had a box for user-feedback, where the respondents told us what they felt were 
                        missing from the software. For example, a respondent suggested we have a way to verify and 
                        rate the feedback, which we implemented into our software. We also had to find a way to report 
                        relocations and such, creating a network between us and various companies who used our software 
                        for accessibility.

                TextMap is a software that builds on already existing solutions to help the visually impaired and 
                people at large. Using the built-in GPS technology of smartphones and building on already existing 
                screenreader applications for the visually impaired, we can extract information about establishments 
                and signs, as they are put in by other users of the app. The app ships with a database that contains 
                information about a large variety of establishments, but over time users would submit more and more 
                information eventually creating a total oversight of restaurant menus, signs, entertainment 
                information, etc. all verified and available in standard English.
